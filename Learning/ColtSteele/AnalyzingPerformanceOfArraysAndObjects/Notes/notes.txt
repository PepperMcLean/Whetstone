  Now that we've convered BIG O...
    Let's spend a couple minutes analyzing the things we do all the time in JS: working with Arrays, Objects, and built-in methods.
  
  Objectives
    Understand how ojects and arrays work, through the lens of Big O
    Explain why adding elements to the beginning of an array is costly
    Compare and contrast the runtime for arrays and objects, as well as built-in methods

  When to use objects
    When you don't need order
    When you need fast access / instertion and removal
  
  Big O of Objects
    Insertion - O(1)
    Removal - O(1)
    Searching - O(n)
    Access - O(1)
    When you don't need any ordering, objects are an excellent choice!

  Big O of Object Methods
    Object.keys - O(n)
    Object.values - O(n)
    Object.entries - O(n)
    hasOwnProperty - O(1)
