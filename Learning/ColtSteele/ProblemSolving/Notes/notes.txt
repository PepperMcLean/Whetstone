Problem Solving Approach
  Objectives
    Define what an algorithm is
    Devise a plan to solve algorithms
    Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer
  
  What is an Algorithm?
    A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.
  
  Why do i need to know this?
    Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm!
    It's the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer

  How do you improve?
    1. Devise a plan for solving problems
    2. Master common problem solving patterns
  
  Problem Solving
    Understand the problem
    Explore concrete examples
    Break it down
    Solve/simplify
    Look back and refactor
