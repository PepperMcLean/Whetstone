//================================================================
// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.
//================================================================

// Understand the Problem
// 1.Can I restate the problem into my own words?
//    Implement Addition
// 2.What are the inputs that go into the problem?
//    -ints? 
//    -floats?
//    -what about string for large numbers?
// 3.What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
//    -int? float? string?
// 4.Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enought information to solve the problem?
//
// 5.How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
